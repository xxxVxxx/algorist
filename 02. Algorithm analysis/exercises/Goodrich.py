	One should devise an assignation heuristic to ensure
	that all testers share a bottle, there's one bottle 
	that is not tested, and ensure combinations as follows:

	Suppose n = 8.

	Testers = [A, B, C]

	A: 2 5 6 7
	B: 3 5 6 8
	C: 4 6 7 8

	1 : [] 			-> nCr(4, 0)
	2 : [A] 		-> nCr(4, 1)
	3 : [B]
	4 : [C]
	5 : [A, B] 		-> nCr(4, 2)
	6 : [A, C]
	7 : [B, C]
	8 : [A, B, C] 	-> nCr(4, 3)

	If no tester dies, the poisoned bottle was 1.
	If just A dies, 2 was poisoned, if just B dies,
	3 was poisoned, if just C dies, then 4 was poisoned.
	If just A and B dies, 5 was poisoned.
	If just A and C dies, 6 was poisoned.
	If just B and C dies, 7 was poisoned.

	If all of them died, 8 was the poisoned bottle.

	The strategy is to generate the testing table,
	that is assign to each tester some bottles, and
	follow the heuristic.

	If there are 8 bottles, we need 3 tester, log2(8) = 3
